         <h2> About </h2>
  
        <p>
             Willie Junior Maxwell II (born June 7, 1991), known professionally as Fetty Wap, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He rose to prominence after his debut single "Trap Queen" reached number two on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in May 2015. This helped Fetty Wap secure a record deal with 300 Entertainment. He subsequently released two Top 10 singles in the U.S., "679" and "My Way". Fetty Wap's eponymously titled debut album was released in September 2015 and reached number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart.

        Willie Maxwell was born on June 7, 1991 and raised in Paterson, New Jersey. Maxwell, born with glaucoma in both eyes, revealed in a 2015 interview that doctors were unable to save his left eye and instead fitted him with an ocular prosthesis. He began taking interest in music in 2013. Initially starting off as only a rapper, he later decided to start singing as well because he "wanted to do something different". He was nicknamed "Fetty" (slang for money) as he was known for making money. "Wap" was added to the end of the name to perform under in tribute to Gucci Mane's alias, GuWop.
        
        For the Trap and B  artist named Fetty Wap known for sharing his love about his ride or die chick on his breakout hit “Trap Queen,” his hustle never stops. Willie Maxwell II hails from New Jersey, like Redman and Joe Budden, calling home to a city called Paterson. The rapper explains it was difficult growing up there, specifically pointing out that “everybody is trying to make it out.” As he adjusts to the attention after blowing up from “Trap Queen” in 2014, his mission in hip-hop isn’t to become more famous, but to use his fortunes to help his community rise above their hardships.

        On his records, Fetty Wap’s wobbly voice cuts through trap instrumentals and melodies, making his honest and aggressive lyrics a staple of Jersey’s rap scene. His likability comes from his influences, which are Gucci Mane (his name pays homage to Gucci’s nickname Guwop) and other trap innovators such as Three 6 Mafia’s Juicy J and Project Pat. His flow on “Trap Queen,” captures the same feelings as his idols, and has ignited remixes from the likes of French Montana, Yo Gotti and Rick Ross. It’s a respectable career trajectory for someone who uploaded freestyled verses of “Trap Queen” to SoundCloud in March 2014. “I was dealing with that person at the time. She was juggin with me,” he says of the song’s inspiration. “We were really trying to make it happen. We got tired of riding regular.” Once Fetty Wap re-recorded the rough copy for radio, the track became the de facto winter anthem.

        This year, Fetty Wap’s profile rose when he earned co-signs from stars like Trey Songz, Rihanna and Kanye West. In February, Fetty Wap was the surprise guest for West’s Roc City Classic show. “I just turned up. That’s all I can remember,” he says. “I’m just mad appreciative. It’s just a big grateful, feeling that’s just one way of putting it.” Since then, Fetty Wap has been featured in Billboard, Complex and nominated for the 2015 XXL Freshman Class, a coveted list of the next wave of rap stars. He’s also used the bigger platform to introduce his crew Remy Boyz 1738, consisting of up-and-coming rappers Montana Buckz and P Dice. With his growing success, he isn’t letting his condition (his left eye was lost to congenital glaucoma when he was a child) get in the way of chasing his dreams.
